# IOT_Project

This is a simple project made by me using adafruit IFTTT (IF This Than That). 
-- First step you need to do is to go to the IFTTT make and account and create a task.
-- Second after creating the task you will get a code that is your account ID.
-- Then you need to set the action of what you need to do after the request to thst page is triggered.
-- Boom you are done.
